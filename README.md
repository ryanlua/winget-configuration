# Personal WinGet Configuration

A collection of my [WinGet Configuration files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/configuration/) which I use on my Windows desktop and laptop machines.

I frequently reset my machines and use these configuration files to quickly set up my environment with the applications and settings I need.
